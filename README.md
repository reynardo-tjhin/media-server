Creating media server for my home use

## Copying files

Go to your machine to copy the files

```sh
# /path/to/file - assuming the file is in a Windows machine
# ~ - the remote_username's path
# 192.168.1.1 is the server/the remote username's machine ip address
scp /path/to/file remote_username@192.168.1.1:~
```
